# BMI Calculator Tool

This Python script creates a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator interface using the Tkinter library. Users can input their weight and height, then click "Calculate" to find out their BMI.

The `calculate_bmi()` function takes user inputs, validates them, and computes the BMI. It then determines the user's weight category based on the calculated BMI.

It includes input fields, a "Calculate" button, and a label to display the results.

Note: The code includes input validation and error handling for accurate calculations and user-friendly interaction.
